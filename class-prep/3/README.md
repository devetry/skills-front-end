### Responding to Events

We have seen how to use Javascript to modify the DOM, but so far the interaction has been a one-way street, with us (the program) doing stuff, and the user just sitting there watching like it's TV. In order to make our web page *interactive*, we need a way of responding to actions coming *from the user*. We want to be able to say, for example, "when the user clicks that button over there, here is what should happen: ...". To allow us to do that, Javascript "listens for events" such as button clicks, and provides an interface for us to specify functions that should be invoked whenever the event occurs.

-----|------|---------------|------|---------------|-------------
<input type="checkbox" v-model="checks.p3a" /> | Read | Interactive Book | [EloquentJS 5: Higher-order Functions][eloquent5] | 3 hours | In order to start writing event handlers for the DOM, you will first need to get comfortable with the concept of a "higher-order" function: a function that accepts *another function* as an argument, or returns another function as its return value. Higher-order functions are somewhat mind-bending at first, but allow for very elegant solutions to all kinds of problems, and in fact are the foundation of a whole area of programming called Functional Programming (which is awesome and you should check it out later).
<input type="checkbox" v-model="checks.p3b" /> | Read | Interactive Book | [EloquentJS 14: Handling Events][eloquent14] | 3 hours | Now for the fun part! In this chapter you will see examples of a bunch of different types of events you can listen for.
<input type="checkbox" v-model="checks.p3c" /> | Read | Article | [Javascript's Map, Reduce and Filter][map-reduce-filter] | 30 minutes | This article talks about some very common higher-order functions for operating on lists: `map`, `filter` and `reduce`.
